<!--# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

Anyways, this site just has some nice animations and stuff and convinces you to use Rust.  
It uses https://ai.hackclub.com/ to generate reasons to use Rust, and then uses Svelte to display them.  
Really simple website.  
I **DO NOT** own Rust, I just like it.  
I **DO NOT** own any images used in this website. They are the rust team logos so they are owned by them.  
If they want me to take down the images, I will happily do so.  
Please just email me at [akaal@akaalroop.com](mailto:akaal@akaalroop.com) if you have any issues with this website.
